# Operational Guide

## Deployment

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

### Backend

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm start`

## Maintenance

### Updating Dependencies

1. Check for outdated dependencies: `npm outdated`
2. Update a specific package: `npm update <package_name>`
3. Update all packages: `npm update`

### Database Migration

1. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
2. Rollback migrations: `npm run rollback`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Server not starting

1. Check if the port specified in the configuration is already in use.
2. Check the logs for any unhandled exceptions.

#### Issue: Database connection failed

1. Check if the database server is running.
2. Verify the database credentials in the configuration.

### Debugging

1. Start the server in debug mode: `npm run debug`
2. Connect a debugger to the specified port.

### Monitoring

1. Use a process manager like PM2 for monitoring the application.
2. Set up alerts for critical issues.

## Security

### Regular Audits

1. Perform regular code audits to identify potential security issues.
2. Use tools like Snyk to automatically check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Data Encryption

1. All sensitive data is encrypted using the `encryptData` function in `backend/utils/encryption.js`.
2. Regularly update encryption keys and algorithms for better security.

### Compliance

1. Regularly review and update practices to ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.

## Performance

### Load Balancing

1. Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.
2. Regularly monitor and adjust the load balancing strategy as needed.

### Caching

1. Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
2. Regularly review and update caching strategies for optimal performance.

### CDN

1. Use a CDN for serving static assets to improve load times.
2. Regularly update the CDN configuration as needed.

## Scalability

1. The application uses a microservices architecture for better scalability.
2. Regularly monitor and adjust the number of instances for each service as needed.
