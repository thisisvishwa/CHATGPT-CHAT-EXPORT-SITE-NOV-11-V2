# Testing Guide

This guide provides an overview of the testing procedures for the ChatGPT Conversation Viewer Platform.

## Automated Testing Pipeline

We use Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress for our automated testing pipeline. The tests are located in the `backend/tests` directory. Each file corresponds to a specific part of the application:

- `auth.test.js`: Tests related to user authentication.
- `conversation.test.js`: Tests related to conversation management.
- `user.test.js`: Tests related to user management.
- `admin.test.js`: Tests related to admin functionalities.
- `moderator.test.js`: Tests related to moderator functionalities.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Performance Testing

Performance testing involves load testing and stress testing. We use tools like Apache JMeter and Google Lighthouse for these tests. The goal is to ensure that our application can handle a large number of users and heavy loads.

## Security Testing

Security testing involves regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. We use tools like OWASP ZAP and Nessus for these tests. The goal is to identify any potential security vulnerabilities in our application.

## Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the tests using `npm run test`.

## Continuous Integration

We use a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically run tests whenever code is pushed to the repository. This helps us catch issues early and ensures that the codebase remains stable.

## Test Coverage

We aim for a high level of test coverage to ensure that all parts of our application are tested. You can generate a test coverage report using the following command:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

This will create a coverage report in the `coverage` directory.

Remember, the goal of testing is not just to find bugs, but to create an application that can be easily maintained and extended in the future. Happy testing!
